Once upon a time while Noob was playing Bedwars he was faced upon Pro and he was toxic. Pro harassed him and made fun of him because Noob had barely any wins and no skill. Then the Pro finished Noob in less than a minute because of how bad he was and ever since that day Noob swore to the Bedwars Gods that he will not stop training and beat Pro and his toxicness. Noob practiced so much that he gained over 1,000,000,000 wins which is WAYYYYYY over ANY person EVER! Even TECHNOBLADE!!!! The Bedwars Gods noticed this and made Noob and Pro fight to the death and whoever loses, would get banned. Noob easily beat Pro from his hard work and the Bedwars Gods made him a god too. The End.
